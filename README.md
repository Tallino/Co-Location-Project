# Co-Location-Project

This is my master thesis, developed at Politecnico di Milano, in collaboration with AnotheReality.
My advisor is Pierluca Lanzi.

This software allows users to colocate in VR with Oculus Quest 1 or 2.

How to use the software:
If you are client ->

Press Grip, Trigger and A button on your right controller to candidate for colocation.
Then leave your controllers on a table near you.
Put your hands behind your back and walk towards the MASTER CLIENT (RED capsule above his head).

If you are admin ->

Leave your controllers on a table near you and walk towards the BLUE capsuled user.
While he keeps his hands behind his back, put your open hands in front of him.
When he sees BOTH of your hands, make a two sign with your right hand (close thumb, ring and pinky fingers).
Repeat until colocation is 100% accurate.
